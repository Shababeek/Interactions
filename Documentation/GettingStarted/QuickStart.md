# Getting Started with Shababeek Interactions â€” 10-Minute Quick Start

Welcome to the Shababeek Interaction System! This guide will get you from zero to grabbing your first VR object in about 10 minutes.

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- âœ… A VR scene set up with hands
- âœ… An object you can pick up and throw
- âœ… Sound effects when grabbing
- âœ… Understanding of the core concepts

**Time Required:** ~10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Unity 2021.3 or newer, VR headset (Quest, PCVR, etc.)

## Step 1: Install the Package (2 minutes)

### Option A: Unity Package Manager (Recommended)
1. Open your Unity project
2. **Window > Package Manager**
3. Click **+** > **Add package from git URL**
4. Enter: `https://github.com/YourRepo/Shababeek-Interactions.git`
5. Click **Add**
![AddFromPackageManager.png](../Images/AddFromPackageManager.png)
### Option B: Download and Import
1. Download the `.unitypackage` from [releases page](https://github.com/Shababeek/Interactions/releases)
2. **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package**
3. Select the downloaded file
4. Click **Import**

### Verify Installation
Check that you see `Shababeek` folder in your Project window:
```
Assets/
â””â”€â”€ Shababeek/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Interactions/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Core/
    â””â”€â”€ Utilities/
```


## Step 2: Create the Config Asset (1 minute), or use the one provided in the asset

The Config asset is the brain of the interaction system. You only create this once per project.

### Use the wizard to create it 
1. Context menu: **Shababeek > Setup wizard**
2. follow the steps on screen
### Create it manually
1. **Right click**-> Shababeek->Inteataction System Config 
![CreateConfig.png](../Images/CreateConfig.png)

### Basic Setup
The Config comes with good defaults, but verify these settings:

#### Essential Settings (in Inspector)
- **Interaction Layers:** Set to a dedicated layers (create them if needed)
- **Hand Data:** Assign the default HandData asset from the list
![ConfigFile.png](../Images/ConfigFile.png)

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** use default settings from the setup wizard and then edit it.

âœ… **Checkpoint:** Config asset created and set up!

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your VR Scene (3 minutes)

### Add XR Origin
If you don't already have a VR setup:

1. `GameObject > Shababeek > Initialize scene` or `context menu->Shababeek-> Initialize scene` 
   - This Deletes the main camera 
   - creates Camera Rig object with some other object inside


### configure CameraRig
1. if the config file is not added automatically, drag it to the camera Rig
![CameraRig.png](../Images/CameraRig.png)


   
âœ… **Checkpoint:** VR hands are set up and ready to interact!( press play and see it in action)

---

## Step 4: Make Your First Grabbable Object (2 minutes)

Time to create something you can pick up!

### Create a Simple Cube
1. **GameObject > 3D Object > Cube**
2. Name it "Grabbable Cube"
3. Position it in front of the player (use Scene view)


### Make It Grabbable
1. Right-click on your Cube: `Shababeek-> Make into-> Grabable`
2. That's it! This will add:
    - a PoseConstrainer component(for hand positioning)
    - a Grabable component 
![MakeGrababel.png](../Images/MakeGrababel.png)
![Grabable.png](../Images/Grabable.png)
### Set the Layer
**optional:** Your object needs to be on the Interactable layer!

1. At the top of Inspector, click **Layer** dropdown
2. Select **Interactable** (or whatever you set in Config)


âœ… **Checkpoint:** You have a grabbable cube!

---

## Step 5: Test It! (1 minute)

Time to try it in VR!

### Press Play
1. Put on your VR headset
2. Click the **Play** button in Unity
3. Reach out toward the cube
4. Press the **Grip** button (side button on your controller)
5. The cube attaches to your hand!
6. Move your hand around - the cube follows
7. Release Grip - the cube drops

## Step 7 configure the Hand Pose


### Troubleshooting Quick Fixes
**Can't see hands?**
- Check Hand component has HandData assigned
- Verify hand prefabs exist in HandData asset

**Can't grab cube?**
- Make sure the selected Input method is enabled in player settings
- Change the Input method in Config file
- Make sure cube has a Collider


âœ… **Checkpoint:** You successfully grabbed an object in VR!

---

## Step 6: Add Grab Sound (2 minutes)

Make it feel more real with audio feedback!

### Prepare Audio
1. Import a sound effect (or use Unity's built-in sound)
2. For this example, we'll use a simple "click" sound

### Add Audio Source
1. Select your Grabbable Cube
2. **Add Component > Audio Source**
3. **Un check** "Play On Awake"
4. Drag your sound file into **AudioClip** field

### Wire Up the Event
1. On the **Grabable** component, find the **Events** section
2. Expand **On Selected**
3. Click the **+** button
4. Drag your **Grabbable Cube** into the **Object** field
5. Click the function dropdown: **AudioSource > Play()**


### Test It Again!
Press Play, put on headset, grab the cube - you should hear your sound!


âœ… **Checkpoint:** Your object now has audio feedback!

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

### Quick Troubleshooting

**Nothing works at all**
1. Check Console for errors
2. Verify Config asset is assigned to Hand components
3. Make sure InteractionLayers match in Config and on your objects

**Hands don't show up**
- HandData must have hand prefabs assigned
- Check Hand component's "Hand Model" field

**Can see hands but can't grab**
- Object must be on Interactable layer
- Object must have a Collider (not set to Trigger)
- Controllers must have TriggerInteractor components

**Objects fly away when grabbed**
- Lower the Mass on the Rigidbody
- Check for collisions with other objects

## Tips for Your First Project

ðŸ’¡ **Start Simple**
Don't try to build everything at once. Master one interaction type, then add more.

ðŸ’¡ **Test in VR Frequently**
What looks good in the Scene view can feel different in VR. Test often!

ðŸ’¡ **Use Prefabs**
Once you have a working grabbable object, make it a prefab to reuse.

ðŸ’¡ **Organize Your Layers**
Create clear layer names (Interactable, UI, Terrain) and use them consistently.

ðŸ’¡ **Watch the Examples**
The example scenes in `Shababeek/Interactions/Examples/` show best practices.
